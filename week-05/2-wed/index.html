          Like other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with
          a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large
          and powerful hind limbs, the forelimbs of Tyrannosaurus were short but
          unusually powerful for their size, and they had two clawed digits. The
          most complete specimen measures up to 12.3 meters (40 feet) in length,
          though T. rex could grow to lengths of over 12.3 m (40 ft), up to 3.96
          m (13 ft) tall at the hips, and according to most modern estimates 8.4
          metric tons (9.3 short tons) to 14 metric tons (15.4 short tons) in
          weight. Although other theropods rivaled or exceeded Tyrannosaurus rex
          in size, it is still among the largest known land predators and is
          estimated to have exerted the strongest bite force among all
          terrestrial animals. By far the largest carnivore in its environment,
          Tyrannosaurus rex was most likely an apex predator, preying upon
          hadrosaurs, juvenile armored herbivores like ceratopsians and
          ankylosaurs, and possibly sauropods. Some experts have suggested the
          dinosaur was primarily a scavenger. The question of whether
          Tyrannosaurus was an apex predator or a pure scavenger was among the
          longest debates in paleontology. Most paleontologists today accept
          that Tyrannosaurus was both an active predator and a scavenger.

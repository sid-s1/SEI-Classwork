HTML 1 -
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
    <script src="javascript.js"></script>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>Nic Cage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage">Nicolas Kim Coppola</a>, known professionally as Nicolas Cage, is an American actor and producer. He has performed in leading roles in a variety of films, ranging from romantic comedies and dramas to science fiction and action films.</p>
  </body>
</html>

Issue - 
No <!DOCTYPE HTML> at the top, before the first <html> tag. The 'doctype' tag needs to be added to announce the language used in the file.

HTML 2 -
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a very small webpage.</h1>
    <p>That's all.</p>
  </body>
</html>

Issue -
Element <head> is missing - and thus the element <title> is missing. The webpage will need to have a 'title' and it must be added within a <head> tag before the body element starts.

HTML 3 -
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
  <title>My Favorite Image</title>
</head>
<body>
  <img src="picture.jpg" />
</body>
</!DOCTYPE html>

Issues -
The 'img' element must have an 'alt' attribute within - this is to show some alternative text in case the image could not load.
The <!DOCTYPE html> at the start does not need a corresponding closing tag at the end.
There must be opening and closing <html></html> tags at the start and end.

HTML 4 -
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Some Thoughts On Turtles
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>I like turtles.</h1>
  </body>
</html>

Issue -
The <title> element is not closed with </title>, which makes all text after it act as part of the webpage title. Thus, the editor will expect a closing tag before the </html> is closed.
There must always be a closing tag </title> for webpage titles within <head>.

QUESTIONS:
1. What does title do?
The <title></title> element can be used to give our webpage a name - this name appears on the browser tab. Example - "myGA | General Assembly" for General Assembly's student dashboard.
2. What information do images need, and why?
The <img> tag needs the following attributes-
*'src' - to signify the course URL or directory link of the image so that the HTML can load that
*'alt' - to signify an alternative stream of text that shows if the image cannot load
Optional - width and height - in case we want to re-size the image without using CSS
3. What's the difference between head and body?
My understanding was that the head tag contains hidden webpage information - like CSS and JS links and the title of the webpage; but the body element includes the actual content of the webpage.

My understanding was elaborated upon by 'trutheality's comment on 'stackoverflow' -
Things in the head tag are things that should not be rendered: information about the page and how to process it, whereas the things in the body tag are the things that should be displayed: the actual content.

And 'azzy81's comment -
CSS and JS files are linked in the <head></head> element as they need to load before the webpage is displayed. Anything in the body section is what we would expect to see on screen.

So now it appears to me that it's a difference between the "HOW" and the "WHAT" (head vs body)
4. Based on the messages from the validator, write the bare minimum HTML you need to have a "valid" webpage.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    
  </head>
  <body>
    
  </body>
</html>
